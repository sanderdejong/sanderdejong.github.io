        <h1>more about me<span class="text-emphasis-blue">.</span></h1>
        <p>
            My background includes designing and implementing distributed systems, building serverless and
            container-based architectures, and working with infrastructure-as-code to support reliable deployments. I
            focus on clean architecture, observability, and performance, with an emphasis on maintainability and
            long-term sustainability.
        </p>
        <p>
            I enjoy working closely with product managers, designers, and fellow engineers to turn ideas into
            well-aligned technical solutions. I’m comfortable taking ownership, giving and receiving feedback, and
            adapting to changing requirements.
        </p>
        <p>
            Outside of work, I enjoy bouldering and badminton, and I like to unwind by reading fantasy. I am naturally
            curious and motivated by continuous improvement, both professionally and personally.
