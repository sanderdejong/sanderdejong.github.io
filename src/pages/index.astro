        <h1>Hi, I am Sander de Jong</h1>
        <p>
            I’m a software engineer with over six years of professional experience, working in both small teams and
            large organizations. I specialize in cloud-native development, primarily using <span class="text-emphasis">Java</span>
            and <span class="text-emphasis">AWS</span>.
        </p>

        <p>
            My background includes designing and implementing distributed systems, building serverless and
            container-based architectures, and working with infrastructure-as-code to support reliable deployments. I
            focus on clean architecture, observability, and performance, with an emphasis on maintainability and
            long-term sustainability.
        </p>

        <p>
            I enjoy working closely with product managers, designers, and fellow engineers to turn ideas into
            well-aligned technical solutions. I’m comfortable taking ownership, giving and receiving feedback, and
            adapting to changing requirements.
        </p>

        <p>
            Outside of work, I enjoy bouldering and badminton, and I like to unwind by reading fantasy. I am naturally
            curious and motivated by continuous improvement, both professionally and personally.
        </p>
